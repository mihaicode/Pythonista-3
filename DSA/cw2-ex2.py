# Exercise 2: Finding a small number of distinct elements
# Each of the following two problems is worth 10 marks.
#
# 1.
# Design an O(logn) algorithm whose input is a sorted list A.
# The algorithm should return true if A contains at least 3 distinct elements.
# Otheriwse the algorithm should return false.
#

# Test Cases
A = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
B = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
B = [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

# A[0] is first element
# distinct = []
# for each element in range 1 to i
# compare A[0] to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
#

# 2.
# Design an O(logn) algorithm whose input is a sorted list A.
# The algorithm should return true if A contains at least 4 distinct elements.
# Otheriwse the algorithm should return false.
# Hint: run the function for part 1 atmost three times
